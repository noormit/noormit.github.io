<h2>Research Projects:</h2>
<h3>Large-scale Matching Algorithms for Robust Causal Inference:</h3>
<p>We develop matching models and algorithms to make robust causal inference decisions from large-scale observational studies. Ensuring robustness in causal inference alone produces a computationally intensive optimization problem. With the usage of big data, such an optimization problem becomes even more difficult to solve. We design scalable computational approaches that can handle large scale optimization problems emerging in robust causal inference, and help make policy decisions in Healthcare, Manufacturing, and Service industries by leveraging the power of big data.</p>

<h3>Healthcare Analytics:</h3>
<p>We analyze large-scale healthcare data by leveraging data mining and machine learning techniques to identify opportunities for improvement in healthcare. Our team has been involved in a number of healthcare analytics projects where multiple large-scale healthcare datasets are being used: <a href="https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/nation/nrd/nrddbdocumentation.jsp">HCUP Nationwide Readmission Database</a>, <a href="https://www.apcdcouncil.org/state-data-access">Massachusetts and New Hampshire All Payer Claim Database</a> and <a href="https://oshpd.ca.gov/data-and-reports/healthcare-utilization/inpatient/">State of California Hospital Discharge Database</a>.</p>
<p><b>Leveraging AI and OR to address the opioid addiction epidemic</b></p>
<p>The opioid overdose epidemic­­­­—a national public health emergency—takes an average of 130 lives in the US every day, 44% of which are attributed to the overdose of legally obtained prescription opioids. The overarching goal of our research is to develop a resilient community against such overdose and addiction epidemic.</p>
<p>Our research indicates that currently, physicians lack effective prescribing tools to help guide the informed and judicious prescribing of opioid analgesics. Moreover, many patients get prescribed with too many opioids of which they don’t use up completely, and surplus drugs are not disposed of properly. This facilitates the diversion of prescription opioids to secondary users and black markets.</p>
<p>We, in particular, leverage state-of-the-art AI, statistical analysis, and operations research techniques to address a multitude of problems centering on the opioid crisis. The focal points of our research are depicted in the following diagram:</p>
