<h2>Research Projects:</h2>
<h3>Robust Causal Inference for Large-Scale Observational Studies:</h3>
<p>We develop matching models and algorithms to make robust causal inference decisions from large-scale observational studies. Ensuring robustness in causal inference alone produces a computationally intensive optimization problem. With the usage of big data, such an optimization problem becomes even more difficult to solve. We design scalable computational approaches that can handle large scale optimization problems emerging in robust causal inference, and help make policy decisions in Healthcare, Manufacturing, and Service industries by leveraging the power of big data.</p>

<h3>Healthcare Analytics:</h3>
<p>We analyze large-scale healthcare data by leveraging data mining and machine learning techniques to identify opportunities for improvement in healthcare. Our team has been involved in a number of healthcare analytics projects where multiple large-scale healthcare datasets are being used: <a href="https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/nation/nrd/nrddbdocumentation.jsp">HCUP Nationwide Readmission Database</a>, <a href="https://www.apcdcouncil.org/state-data-access">Massachusetts and New Hampshire All Payer Claim Database</a> and <a href="https://oshpd.ca.gov/data-and-reports/healthcare-utilization/inpatient/">State of California Hospital Discharge Database</a>.</p>
<p><b>Leveraging AI and OR to address the opioid addiction epidemic</b></p>
<p>The opioid crisis in the United States has reached alarming proportions, as evidenced by the staggering statistics. In 2021, the number of individuals who lost their lives due to drug overdoses surpassed six times the figures recorded in 1999. Even more concerning, 
the year 2021 witnessed a distressing 16 percent surge in drug overdose deaths compared to the previous year, with opioids implicated in over 75 percent of the nearly 107,000 fatalities. A deeper analysis of the crisis reveals a complex landscape: while opioid-related death rates
increased by over 15 percent, prescription opioid fatalities remained constant. On a more hopeful note, heroin-related deaths decreased by nearly 32 percent, but synthetic opioids (excluding methadone) saw a troubling rise of more than 22<tt>. This crisis has become a critical 
issue demanding urgent attention and comprehensive solutions (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023). In Massachusetts, death rate increased to 33.5 per 100,000 people in 2022, 2.5</tt> higher than in 2021 and 9.1 percent higher than the pre-pandemic peak in 2016. </p>
<p>Our research indicates that currently, physicians lack effective prescribing tools to help guide the informed and judicious prescribing of opioid analgesics. Moreover, many patients get prescribed with too many opioids of which they donâ€™t use up completely, and surplus drugs are not disposed of properly. This facilitates the diversion of prescription opioids to secondary users and black markets.</p>
<p>To address this critical crisis, We have been involved in multiple research projects pertinent to opioid crisis funded by a series of grants from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in partnership with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) and an NSF CAREER. 
This work has led us to identify the key areas (e.g., blue dashed box in the Figure) to address this multifaceted critical challenge and how to tackle it by leveraging sophisticated AI and OR techniques.  </p>
